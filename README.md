<b>Step 2: Trace a route to a remote server with [tracert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tracert)</b>

Each hop in the tracert results displays the routes that the packets take when traveling to the final destination.  When the final destination is reached, an ICMP echo reply is sent to the source host.
